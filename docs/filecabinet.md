# A Filing Cabinet For All

What's the point behind having a filing cabinet?

Well, the filing cabinet is a *feature store*.
What that really *means* is that when you spin up a Filing Cabinet you spin up a class which presents a standardized API for querying data.
You can query for experiment results.
You can query for data.
You can query for anything your heart can desire.

There's a standardized API wrapping everything.

If you already *have* a Filing Cabinet running, and simply want to present an API for allowing trusted agents to connect, this is intended to allow for that.
